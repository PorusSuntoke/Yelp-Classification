# Yelp-Classification
In this project, Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies were used to analyze data consisting of Yelp reviews.
Number of 'stars' indicate the business rating given by a customer, ranging from 1 to 5.
'Cool', 'Funny', 'Useful' indicate the number of cool votes given by other Yelp users.
In this project, I first performed data cleaning on the dataset. 
Then I removed punctuation along with stopwords from text.
After that I applied CountVectorizer to the modified dataset.
Lastly I used the TF-IDF technique on this dataset.
